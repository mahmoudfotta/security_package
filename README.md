this is security package implemented in it some security algorithms
#
some over a network and others not.
#
First the algorithms that is not over a network
#
1-General Ceaser.
#
2-Monoalphapetic.
#
3-Autokey Vigenère. 
#
4-Repeating key Vigenère.
#
5-Play Fair.
#
6-Rail Fence.
#
7-Columnar.
#
8-Hill Cipher.
#
Second algorithms over a network
#
1-RC4.
#
2-RSA.
#
3.Multiplicative Inverse using Extended Euclid’s.
#
4- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
#
and device1 represent the project that will work in the sender computer and also contain the algorithms that won't
#
work over a network and device2 represent the project that will work in the reciver computer.
